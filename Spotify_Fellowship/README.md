Question 1:
    Using your preferred language, please create an input string and then demonstrate how you would reverse it. For example: an input of "Programming is so much fun!" should return "!nuf hcum os si gnimmargorP". Do *not* use a built-in method, and be sure that your code is written clearly, in a way that enables others to easily understand your approach. 
Question 2:
    Using your preferred language, please create an input array and then write a function to return the second smallest element in that array. For example: an input of {42, 8, 13, 79, 5, 2, 18} should return 5. *
